# Event-System Design Notes

## Identity and authority authoring contract

The player is the persistent Custodian AI. Captains and councils are human actors;
their priorities, objections, and fallback actions must be attributed in the text and
the log. A description may state observed ship facts and recorded policy outcomes, but
it must not invent a private Custodian feeling or an unchosen human thought.

Every identity-sensitive event must answer three questions before it is added:

1. Does the Custodian act under standing mandate, propose an action for human
   ratification, or invoke an explicitly authored emergency power?
2. If the timer expires, which legal human office acts, and why is that response safe?
3. Which durable flag, obligation, or reputation change records the choice so a later
   callback can cite it without reconstructing trimmed log text?

Automatic acts such as remembered alarms or birthdays require an established policy
gate, or they become selectable decisions. A severe outcome must be tied to an event
flag or prior policy choice; a reputation value alone can weight content but cannot
invent a consequential action. Preserve event IDs and compatible consequence flags
when revising authored voice so existing saves still resolve.

*Living content-authoring reference: the working map onto the shipped
`family × phase × gate` system. All event content lives under `assets/events/`,
**one file per family** (`assets/events/<family>.json`, e.g. `comedy.json`),
merged into one registry at load with a duplicate-id guard; add a new event to
its family's file (add a new family = a new file + one line in `EVENT_FILES` in
`src/data.rs`). Only the phase-pool table (mechanics) lives in code.*

## Principle: generate scenarios from **families × complications × outcomes**, not one-offs

An event = a **family** + optional **complication/twist** + **outcome branches**.
A handful of authored families cover a centuries-long voyage without visible
repetition — critical now that a single mission spans 300–600 years and dozens of
decisions. `EventCategory` (`ImmediateCrisis` / `GenerationalChallenge` /
`MissionMilestone` / `LegacyMoment`) stays the **scoring/weighting axis**; the
`family` tag is the **content-organisation + gating axis**.

## The ten families (canonical strings)

| Family | Maps to category (guidance) | Buffering subsystem (W5) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `exploration_first_contact` | LegacyMoment / MissionMilestone | — | Mostly Travel; big branching decisions |
| `diplomacy` | GenerationalChallenge | `security` | Travel & on-station; influence/piracy ties |
| `engineering` | ImmediateCrisis | `engineering_bay` | Any phase; core ship faults |
| `biology_medical` | ImmediateCrisis | `medical_bay` | The medical-bay upgrade loop |
| `science_anomaly` | LegacyMoment / MissionMilestone | — | Travel; risk/reward; can shift voyage length |
| `survival` | ImmediateCrisis | `agriculture` | Pressure-tests provisioning (food/fuel) |
| `mystery` | MissionMilestone | — | Ghost signals, derelicts, artifacts; salvage hooks |
| `comedy` | LegacyMoment / MissionMilestone | — | Tension-breakers, low stakes ("Lobites") |
| `ethics` | GenerationalChallenge | — | The "soul" — moral dilemmas |
| `legacy_drift` | GenerationalChallenge | `education_culture` | **Headline family** — only makes sense at century scale |

## The Long-Term Expedition family (`legacy_drift`) is the signature of this redesign

The century-scale beats a 300-year no-cryo voyage unlocks and short missions cannot,
**gated on year / generation / voyage-drift** so they read as *consequences* of the
long voyage rather than random rolls:

- `home_silence` (`min_year: 100`) — the home civilization stops answering; the
  mission stops being an errand for someone else.
- `the_faith` (`min_generation: 5`, `min_cultural_drift: 0.5`) — the mission becomes
  a religion; the charter is read as scripture.
- `the_schism_deepens` (`min_cultural_drift: 0.6`) — the ship splits into two peoples;
  the "let them part" branch carries `faction_loss: departed`.
- `cultural_schism` (W7) — the earlier, ungated schism; also `faction_loss: departed`.
- `returning_signal` (`min_year: 100`) — a changed voice from a changed home.

## Phase-aware weighting — the campaign skeleton (W6)

At LAUNCH, `event_resolver::skeleton::generate_beats` lays out one major beat per full
20 years of mission duration (skipping the first 5 years), each placed randomly within
its own 20-year window and drawn from the phase-appropriate pool for the month it
falls in. Same seed ⇒ same schedule. The monthly loop fires each beat when its month
arrives; a beat **replaces** that month's reactive/filler roll, and falls through to a
normal roll if its family is over-gated.

Phase pools (mechanics — the code table in `skeleton.rs`; the families are content):

- **Travel:** `exploration_first_contact`, `science_anomaly`, `diplomacy`, `mystery`, `engineering`
- **Operation:** `survival`, `diplomacy`, `engineering`, `mystery`
- **Return:** `legacy_drift`, `ethics`, `mystery`
- **Any phase (always added):** `biology_medical`, `comedy`

## Force-return & faction-loss beats

- Catastrophic `force_return` (Operation-gated): `crop_blight`; plus W2's `reactor_scram`.
- Fortunate `force_return` (Travel-gated windfall): `the_lodestar`; plus W2's `resupply_cache`.
- `faction_loss: settled`: `garden_world` (the canonical garden-world stop), `berth_lottery` (W7).
- `faction_loss: departed`: `cultural_schism` (W7), `the_schism_deepens`.
- **House rule:** `force_return` / `faction_loss` are never the first outcome (index 0), so the
  autoplay's dumb first-choice policy keeps the mission on-course; they are the deliberate,
  dramatic branch.


## Current inventory

The per-family template counts and the schema features in use are tracked in the
baseline table in `content_depth.md`; keep that one current rather than a second copy here.
