# Stellar Legacy — Game Design Document

*Draft v0.1 — living document.*

> A generational starship strategy game about sending a living ship-civilization on
> missions that take decades or centuries to complete. You don't command a disposable
> crew — you build a legacy. Captains age out, children inherit roles, promises outlive
> the people who made them, and every voyage reshapes the society aboard your vessel.

## 0. Migration Snapshot

- **Old game:** `game_apps/stellar_legacy/` — a React 19 + Zustand frontend with a thin
  PHP/Slim backend that does nothing but persist an opaque JSON save blob behind the
  shared WebHatchery login. All game rules live client-side in `frontend/src/services/*`.
- **Why it was picked:** `migration_candidates.md` Tier 3 — "generational dynasty-management
  strategy; conceptually close to `apartment`'s succession/portfolio mechanic, different
  setting." Not a zero-art-liability slam dunk like the Tier 1 picks, but it turns out to
  have **no art liability at all** (see below) and fills a genre the Rust catalog doesn't
  have: nothing else in `standing.md` is a multi-generation succession sim built around a
  single ship-civilization rather than a multi-building/multi-settlement portfolio.

- **Art-liability audit.** This is the unusual case the template asks to call out
  explicitly: the old game commissioned **zero art**. A full source grep for
  `.png/.jpg/.jpeg/.svg/.gif/.webp` under `frontend/src` returns nothing, there's no
  `assets/`/`public/` art directory, and no canvas/WebGL/icon library is even a
  dependency. The entire UI is a deliberate **text/CSS "terminal" aesthetic** — monospace
  font, amber/green/red phosphor palette (`--terminal-primary:#FFB000`,
  `--terminal-success:#00FF66`, ASCII box-drawing borders). That look ports almost
  verbatim:

  | Old asset (web) | Art cost | Rust replacement |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Terminal chrome (`TerminalWindow`, ASCII borders, phosphor palette) | None (CSS only) | `ui` `SurfaceStyle`/`TextStyle` + a monospace bitmap font; reuse the same hex palette via `colors` |
  | Ship/crew/dynasty/planet iconography | None (text labels only) | Keep as text/short glyphs; no icon commissioning needed |
  | Galaxy map | None (a list, not a rendered map) | Toolkit `math`/simple 2D node layout if a literal starmap view is kept (see §7); otherwise stays a list panel |

  Nothing here requires an artist. The entire "port" is a systems/content problem, not an
  art problem — which also means there's no cost saved by *cutting* systems for art
  reasons; every cut below is a scope/complexity call, not an art-avoidance call.

- **Mechanic carry-over table.**

  | Old mechanic | Disposition | Notes |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Resources/ship/crew/market "Phase 0" loop | Keep, redesign | The unbounded browser `setInterval` loop becomes a deterministic month simulation driven by a player-facing real-time clock. While under way it auto-advances at Pause / 1× / 2× / 3×; in drydock it is frozen. Ship/crew/market data lives in `assets/*.json`. |
  | Star system explore/colonize ("Galaxy Map", up to 50 systems + trade routes) | Redesign, scope down | The multi-system empire-building framing overlaps `frontier`/`realmseed`/`empire_builder`'s genre slot and was never implemented past a system list + one boost stat. Ported as: the ship's current mission has a handful of relevant systems (origin, waypoints, destination), not a sprawling colonial empire. |
  | 4-resource market buy/sell w/ price trends | Keep as-is | Already fully implemented, simple, fine. |
  | Generational Mission sim (population, resources, phases, milestones, success metrics) | Keep — this is the core system | This *is* the game. Ported wholesale but content-expanded (only 4 event templates existed — see §8) and with the dead colonization-boost code path (§5.1) actually fixed. |
  | Dynasty succession (age, leader handoff at 70, 25-year generation tick) | Keep as-is | Solid, simple, working formula (see §5.3). |
  | 3 Legacy factions (Preservers/Adaptors/Wanderers) + per-legacy dilemmas | Keep, fix | Dilemma resolution math is real and good; several inputs (`traditionPoints`, `bodyHorrorEvents`, `existentialDread`, `piracyReputation`) were hardcoded placeholders never actually tracked — port makes these real tracked state. |
  | Dynasty Hall / Legacy Relations / Cultural Evolution actions (~15 buttons, ~13 of them cosmetic no-ops) | Redesign | Collapse to ~5–6 actions that actually move real `Population`/`Dynasty` stats (unity, culturalDrift, legacyLoyalty, influence already exist in the data model — just weren't wired to most buttons). No flavor-text-only actions in the port. |
  | Legacy Deck (narrative card meta-game) | Cut for v1 | Fully scaffolded in types/services but **unreachable in play** — every card-content generator except one returns `null`/stub, and no `LegacyCard` is ever created in a real playthrough. Revisit only as a post-v1 stretch (§12). |
  | Chronicle + Heritage (cross-playthrough meta-progression) | Redesign, scope down | The Chronicle is a lightweight persistent log. Its cumulative renown selects the highest unlocked Heritage tier automatically when a new dynasty is founded; that tier grants a small, deterministic resource/tradition head start. There is no modifier-selection screen. |
  | Pacing/"AI director" (time acceleration, engagement scoring, emergent event scheduling) | Redesign, scope down | The "engagement score" heuristic isn't derived from real telemetry and most of its methods are stubs. Replaced with explicit player-facing time controls (step 1 year / step to next decision) and a simple rule: always pause on a decision-required event. |
  | Automation/Council delegation (auto-resolve events via advisor AI) | Keep, simplified | The outcome-scoring auto-resolver (`evaluateOutcomeScore`) is real and reasonable; keep as an optional per-domain delegation so late-game "century-scale" ticking doesn't require manual resolution of every event. |
  | Phase1SimulationService ("vertical slice" demo tab) | Cut as a separate screen; keep its design | Isolated from the rest of the game in the original. Its shape — monthly tick, seeded LCG RNG, contract-due-date scoring, banded event outcomes — is the cleanest, most tractable model in the whole codebase and becomes the blueprint for the unified simulation tick (§5), not a standalone demo mode. |
  | PHP backend, WebHatchery shared login, server-side save slots | Cut | Confirmed to contain zero game rules — it's a JSON-blob store behind auth. A standalone Rust/Steam/itch game doesn't want an online account system; local save slots via `macroquad-toolkit::persistence` replace it entirely (see §7). |

- **Explicitly out of scope for the port:** multiplayer/netcode, real-money mechanics
  (none existed), the Legacy Deck card meta-game (v1), any server-authoritative or
  account-gated save system, literal galaxy-spanning multi-system empire management
  (that's `frontier`/`realmseed`/`empire_builder`'s job).

---

## 1. High Concept

- **Pitch:** You are the standing council of a generation ship — a vessel that is also a
  city, a company, and a dynasty. Every choice you make will be inherited by people who
  aren't born yet; every promise your ship makes to the galaxy will still be owed a
  century later, by someone else's grandchildren.
- **Genre:** Generational strategy / succession sim. Distinct from the catalog's existing
  kingdom-builders (`realmseed`, `frontier`) and city-management sims (`apartment`) —
  those manage *places*; this manages *one vessel's bloodline* across unbroken decades.
- **Perspective & presentation:** UI-only, no world/map rendering in the traditional
  sense — a text/log-driven "terminal" interface (retained wholesale from the original,
  see §0) with panels, meters, and an event log. No `camera`/`sprite` work needed; this
  is almost entirely the toolkit's `ui` module.
- **Tone:** Dry, procedural, slightly cold — a ship's log and a corporate ledger that
  happen to contain human tragedy and triumph. Understatement over melodrama; let the
  numbers (a population that "diminished," a dynasty that "went extinct") carry weight.
- **Comparables:** *Reigns* (succession-by-decision at a remove from any individual
  character), *FTL* (long-haul crisis events under resource pressure), *Star Traders:
  Frontiers* (text-forward sci-fi systems depth without character art).
- **Audience:** Strategy/sim players who want systems depth and long-arc consequence over
  spectacle — the same audience `realmseed`'s chronicle-driven campaign appeals to, but
  wanting a tighter single-vessel focus instead of a multi-settlement realm.
- **Scope:** Full game (not a vertical slice) — see §13 for staged milestones.
- **Platforms:** itch.io + Steam via WebGL and native Windows (standard for this catalog).

## 2. Design Pillars

1. **Generations, not runs.** A single playthrough is meant to span multiple leaders,
   multiple completed contracts, multiple event chains — not one mission and done. A
   system that only matters for one leader's lifetime is a candidate for cutting.
2. **Every decision is a debt someone else pays.** Resource choices, dilemma resolutions,
   and delegation settings should have consequences that surface turns or generations
   later (unpaid maintenance, a resentful cohort, a legacy grudge) — this is the whole
   point of "Legacy and Consequence" from the original pitch, and it must be backed by
   real state changes, not the old build's flavor-text no-ops.
3. **The log is honest.** If a system isn't deep enough to show real numbers changing,
   it doesn't get a panel that implies otherwise. The original's Legacy Deck and Chronicle
   analytics looked rich in the type system and were empty in play — the port doesn't
   repeat that mistake (§0 redesigns exist specifically to close this gap).
4. **Centuries move at the speed of decisions, not a clock.** ~~No background real-time
   ticking (the original's `setInterval` resource loop). Time advances only when the
   player asks it to, so a "century-scale mission" is legible and deterministic, not a
   race against a wall-clock timer.~~
   **Superseded (real-time loop).** Time now auto-advances while a mission is under way
   (1 month per 0.25 s at 1×, `real_time.seconds_per_month`), controllable with a
   Pause / 1× / 2× / 3× selector; **docked, time is frozen** so refit and charter choice
   are unhurried. A blocked council decision holds the clock and **auto-resolves to a
   random option after 30 s** (`real_time.decision_timeout_secs`). The *sim internals*
   stay seeded (event rolls, ranged impacts, and timeout picks all draw from `sim.rng`),
   so a manual `advance_*` still replays deterministically — but the live wall-clock pace
   and player-timed choices mean a played session is no longer a strict seed replay.
   The decision still *matters*; it just no longer waits forever.
5. **Succession is a mechanic, not a screen transition.** Leader death/retirement,
   heir selection, and generational aging (§5.3) drive real gameplay stakes — new leaders
   bring different skills, and the player should feel the loss of a specialist captain.

---

## 3. Core Loop

**Session loop** (month-precise while a charter is active):

1. Review the ship/colony dashboard — resources, population, hull/life-support health,
   any pending decision-required events.
2. Allocate the turn: assign crew/cohort focus, spend resources on ship components,
   crew training, or colony development; adjust delegation settings.
3. Let the underway clock auto-advance at 1× / 2× / 3×, or pause it. Monthly ticks
   apply production, population change, dynasty aging, and event rolls.
4. Resolve any event that requires a decision (or let a delegated advisor auto-resolve
   it, per §5.4). Auto-resolved events still log their outcome.
5. Repeat until the active mission/contract reaches its target duration or fails outright.

**Campaign loop** (spans the whole playthrough, mirrors `realmseed/gdd.md`'s
prototype/full split):

1. Accept a long-term contract (mission objective + target system + duration).
2. Prepare the ship, crew, and finances for it (§3 session loop, steps 1–2).
3. Survive the contract's duration through the session loop, generation after
   generation.
4. Resolve the contract (complete / partial / pyrrhic / failure — §5.2) and record it to
   the Chronicle.
5. Use the outcome — resources, reputation, a surviving dynasty — to prepare the next
   contract or expand the ship itself.
6. Continue until the ship's dynasty goes extinct or the player chooses to retire the
   save. On the next founding, Chronicle renown automatically grants the highest
   unlocked Heritage tier (§7).

### 3.1 The Voyage-and-Return Refit Loop (v2 direction, 2026-07-19)

*Owner-directed refinement of the campaign loop above. The intent: make one **mission
run** the unit of play, felt as a departure-and-homecoming arc, with a between-missions
refit economy that gives past success somewhere to go.*

- **A run = one mission (charter) flown by a persistent ship.** The ship is a single
  continuous `SimState` across missions — it is not rebuilt between charters. Accepting a
  charter is *casting off*; the contract's `return → completion` phases are the ship
  *arriving back*; the moment `contract == None` again is *in drydock*.
- **The arc within a run — hope in, wear out.** A ship leaves port fresh and whole
  (pristine hull/life-support, high morale and unity, a population still close to the
  founders). Over the mission's decades the hull decays, spare parts are spent, and — new
  in v2 — the *people themselves drift* year over year: adaptation and cultural drift rise,
  legacy loyalty shifts toward the faction's pull, and the strain of a long voyage erodes
  morale and unity. The crew that comes home is measurably not the crew that left; the ship
  comes home "held together on hope and prayers." Legacy flavors the rate (Adaptors embrace
  the drift and change fastest; Preservers resist it; Wanderers wear it as identity).
- **Underway vs. in port — two toolsets, and the split is the point.** *During a mission*
  (`contract == Some`) the ship can only be kept limping: **field repairs** patch hull and
  life support using what the ship *carries* (spare parts, minerals) and never restore it to
  pristine, and a component **found on the voyage** (salvaged from a derelict or an event)
  *may* be field-installed — but only if the crew and the part allow it: a capable engineer
  aboard, a part that tolerates a field swap, and the spare parts to do it. There is no
  catalog shopping in the black. A long mission is therefore a slow problem of keeping a
  decaying ship alive on what you brought and what you find. *In port* everything opens up
  (next bullet).
- **Homecoming → drydock → cast off again.** On arrival the run resolves to a *Homecoming*
  summary (years elapsed, hull and population change since departure, reward banked). Only in
  **drydock** (`contract == None`) can the ship be fully set right, spending the reward on:
  - **Full repair** — restore hull integrity, life support, fuel, and spare parts to whole
    (port-only; the field kit underway can't reach pristine).
  - **Full loadout** — install any hull/engine/weapon from the whole component catalog
    (the existing Ship Builder), plus freely fit any parts salvaged underway. Port-only.
  - **Commission a new ship** — a large purchase that swaps the hull and returns the vessel
    to pristine condition with a one-time morale/hope lift, for when repairs can no longer
    keep the old hull flying. Port-only. A new *ship*, never new *people*: cultural drift does
    not reset — the dynasty and its changed population always carry forward.
- **What persists, what ends — carry on success, reset only on game-over.** When a run
  ends in *success* (the mission completes), the ship, its loadout, resources, and above all
  the **dynasty and its drifted population carry across** to the next mission — the people
  continue to build the legacy (they already live in the one saved `SimState`; unrepaired
  wear compounds run over run). The *only* thing that resets is **game-over: dynasty
  extinction**, which ends that run early and starts the player over with a **new ship and
  new people** (a fresh `SimState`). Renown still accrues to the Chronicle across all of it
  and can gate larger, richer charters for later runs (escalation, not reset).
- **Pacing — ~1 hour soft cap, ~30 min floor.** One successful mission run should pace to
  roughly **30–60 minutes** of real play: ~1 hour is a soft cap, and a run should *not* come
  in **under 30 minutes** — the only way a run ends sooner is game-over (extinction). Reached
  by tuning mission length (in-game years) against decision density (events, dilemmas) plus
  the drydock phase, **and** the real-time auto-advance cadence (`real_time.seconds_per_month`
  × the 1×/2×/3× selector — Pillar 4, superseded). A cosmetic wall-clock run timer surfaces so
  the floor/cap can be measured and felt; the mission must be sized so even brisk play at 3×
  cannot clear it in under ~30 minutes.

The voyage-and-return refit loop this describes is built; see `content_depth.md` for the
standing direction of further deepening passes.

## 4. Player Role & Verbs

- **The player is:** the standing council of the ship — not any single character. No
  avatar, no player-character portrait or death.
- **The player directly controls:** resource allocation, ship component purchases, crew
  training/recruitment/heir designation, contract acceptance, event decisions, delegation
  settings, time advancement pace.
- **The player does NOT control:** individual non-leader crew/cohort members'
  day-to-day behavior (population and cohorts are simulated in aggregate), the exact
  timing or content of random events (rolled, weighted by ship/population state), an
  advisor's specific choice once a domain is delegated (only that a domain *is*
  delegated).
- **Core verb list:** *Allocate* (resources/crew), *Advance* (time), *Decide* (resolve an
  event/dilemma), *Delegate* (hand a domain to an advisor), *Build* (ship components),
  *Recruit/Train* (crew), *Select Heir*, *Accept/Abandon* (a contract), *Trade* (market).

## 5. Systems & Mechanics

### 5.1 Resource Economy

| Resource | Meaning | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credits | General currency | Spent on components, crew, contracts |
| Energy | Ship power | Consumed by systems, gates exploration actions |
| Minerals | Raw material | Spent on components, colony development |
| Food | Population upkeep | Population penalty below a threshold |
| Influence | Political/reputation currency | Gates diplomacy/contract options |
| Population, Unity, Stability, Legacy Loyalty, Adaptation, Cultural Drift | Colony-scale simulation stats (0–1 or count) | Drive event weighting and dilemma risk (§5.3–5.4) |
| Hull Integrity, Life Support, Fuel, Spare Parts | Ship-condition stats (0–1 or count) | Below-threshold values increase crisis-event weight |

```text
per_turn_generated[resource] = floor(production_rate[resource] * years_elapsed)
production_rate starts from ship/component base rates + colony development bonuses
```

Carried over from the original, **with the fix applied**: colonizing a planet whose
resource list matches a tracked resource actually increases that resource's
`production_rate` (the original computed this bonus against a fresh object where the key
was never pre-populated, so the boost silently never applied — a genuine dead-code bug,
not a design choice, and the port initializes the rate table with all tracked keys up
front so the bonus lands).

### 5.2 Contract (Mission) Progression

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `objective` | mining / colonization / exploration / rescue |
| `target_duration` | years to reach 100% phase progress |
| `current_phase` | preparation → travel → operation → return → completion |
| `success_metrics` | weighted 0–1 targets (population survival, mission completion, resource efficiency, social cohesion) |

```text
success_score = Σ( min(1, metric.current / metric.target) * metric.weight )
score >= 0.9 -> complete
score >= 0.75 -> partial
score >= 0.45 -> pyrrhic
else         -> failure
```

Kept as-is from the original — this formula is sound and doesn't need redesign, only
more contract *content* (objective-specific milestones/risks — currently 2 base +
1 objective-specific milestone, 4 base + 1 objective-specific success metric, 3 base +
1 legacy-specific failure risk; see §8 for expansion targets).

### 5.3 Dynasty & Succession

~~Every 25 years members age by 25, elders past `member_max_age` pass on, a leader past
70 hands off, and 1-3 new members join.~~ **Superseded (real-time loop): aging and death
are now continuous.**

```text
Founding Day (each year-end): everyone shares one birthday, whatever their true
  birthdate — every living dynasty member and crew officer ages += 1. Officers past
  their term (68) stand down; a line below its target size (8), with ≥2 members left
  to carry it on, sees young adults come of age (annual_birth_chance per open slot).

Each month (mortality::monthly_tick): every character faces a death roll —
  chance = accident_floor + (age >= 50 ? base * 2^((age-50)/doubling) : 0), certain
  at member_max_age (90). A dead leader (or one past 70 with an heir ready) hands off
  to the eligible heir (age 30-50, highest leadership; designated heir first; failing
  the band, the best survivor — a ship is never uncaptained while anyone lives).
  The last of the line gone = extinction (§7).

Plus: a heavy population-loss event may claim a named crew officer or relative
  (mortality::event_claim).
```

The lore: on a sealed generation ship the calendar, not the cradle, marks the years —
so **everyone celebrates on Founding Day** and ages together. Death, though, comes when
it comes, a low monthly hazard that climbs with age. Continuous mortality means the crew
the player commands genuinely turns over across a centuries-long voyage; the yearly
renewal is its counterweight, and a line worn down faster than it renews dies out. This
is the mechanical heart of "Generational Command." All rolls flow through the seeded RNG,
so a hand-stepped `advance_*` still replays — but the live real-time run does not (§Pillar 4).

### 5.4 Event System

```text
event_chance = min(0.8, 0.3 + years_elapsed * 0.1 + (current_year / target_duration) * 0.2)

category weights:
  immediate_crisis      base, scales up when food<500, energy<1000,
                         hull_integrity<0.7, life_support<0.8,
                         morale<0.5, unity<0.4
  generational_challenge flat 0.3
  mission_milestone      0.4 near phase boundaries (progress>80% or <20%), else 0.15
  legacy_moment           min(0.1 + floor(year/25)*0.05, 0.3)
```

If an event doesn't require a player decision (or a domain has been delegated, §4), it
auto-resolves: each outcome is scored and the highest-scoring one is applied.

```text
outcome_score = food_weight(x2 if food<500) + hull/life_support penalty (x1000 if below threshold)
              + credits*0.1 + energy*0.2 + minerals*0.3 + morale*500 + unity*600
              - 100 per long-term negative consequence
```

Delegation is intentionally legacy-neutral. Legacy identity changes event availability,
dilemmas, drift, and tracked state elsewhere; the advisor ranks the immediate material
outcomes shown here without a hidden legacy preference.

**Content gap to close:** the original ships **4 hardcoded event templates** total
(`system_failure`, `population_growth`, `arrival_at_target`, `cultural_schism`) for a
system meant to carry a century-scale campaign. See §8 for the port's target count.

### 5.5 Legacy Factions & Dilemmas

Three player-selected legacies, each with a distinct dilemma set and failure condition:

| Legacy | Dilemma flavor | Failure risk name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preservers | Tradition vs. adaptation pressure | `cultural_collapse` |
| Adaptors | Genetic/cybernetic/biological modification (weighted success rolls, e.g. 70%/75%/60%) | `humanity_loss` |
| Wanderers | Raiding/piracy (payout scales with a severity roll: `1000 + severity*2000` success vs. `-500` failure) | `fleet_dissolution` |

```text
risk += 30 if culturalDrift > 0.7
risk += 25 if unity < 0.3
risk += 35 if tradition_points < 20
at-risk if total_risk > 50
```

Kept — the math is real and good. **Fixed in the port:** the original hardcoded several
of these inputs (`traditionPoints`, `bodyHorrorEvents`, `existentialDread`,
`piracyReputation`) as constants that were never actually updated by play (e.g.
`traditionPoints` was always 50). The port tracks these as real per-dynasty/per-legacy
state, updated by the relevant dilemmas and events, so the failure-risk system means
something.

### 5.6 Randomness & Determinism

- **What's randomized:** event category/outcome selection, dilemma success rolls, random
  crew/dynasty-member generation, planet generation.
- **What must stay deterministic:** the whole simulation tick, for saves/replay/tests.
  The original's `Phase1SimulationService` already modeled this correctly with a seeded
  LCG (`state = (1664525*state + 1013904223) >>> 0`) — the port standardizes on the
  toolkit's `rng` module seeded the same way, isolated from `macroquad::rand`, per
  `CODE_STANDARDS.md` §5.

## 6. Data Model (`assets/*.json`)

```json
// assets/ship_components.json — hulls/engines/weapons and their cost/stat deltas
{
  "hulls": [{ "id": "light_corvette", "cost": { "credits": 500 }, "stats": { "cargo": 100, "crew_capacity": 6 } }],
  "engines": [{ "id": "ion_drive", "cost": { "credits": 800, "minerals": 50 }, "stats": { "speed": 2 } }],
  "weapons": [{ "id": "pulse_cannon", "cost": { "credits": 600 }, "stats": { "combat": 3 } }]
}
```

```json
// assets/events.json — weighted event templates by category, with per-outcome effects
{
  "id": "reactor_breach",
  "category": "immediate_crisis",
  "legacy_modifiers": { "adaptors": 1.2 },
  "outcomes": [
    { "id": "emergency_vent", "resource_delta": { "energy": -200 }, "population_effect": { "morale": -5 } }
  ]
}
```

```json
// assets/legacies.json — the 3 legacy factions, their dilemmas and failure-risk weights
{ "id": "preservers", "dilemmas": ["...":"..."], "failure_risk": "cultural_collapse" }
```

| File | Defines | Loaded via |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assets/ship_components.json` | Hulls/engines/weapons + cost/stat deltas | `data_loader::load_json_file` |
| `assets/events.json` | Event templates, categories, outcomes, legacy modifiers | `DataRegistry` |
| `assets/legacies.json` | 3 legacy factions, dilemma sets, failure-risk weights | `DataRegistry` |
| `assets/dynasty_names.json` | Name pools, specializations, traits per legacy | `data_loader::load_json_file` |
| `assets/contracts.json` | Objective templates: milestones, success metrics, failure risks | `DataRegistry` |
| `assets/crew_archetypes.json` | Roles, background strings, starting skill ranges | `data_loader::load_json_file` |
| `assets/data/texture_manifest.json` | (empty/minimal — no sprite art; kept for toolkit consistency) | `AssetManager` |
| `assets/data/game_config.json` | Tunable constants: tick costs, thresholds, notification limits | `data_loader::load_json_file` |

Native builds read `assets/` from disk with an `include_str!` fallback for WASM — this
game has no hot-reload requirement beyond normal balance iteration, so embed-only
(like `template/`) is sufficient; no need for live disk reload during play.

## 7. World & Progression Structure

- **World layout:** no rendered map/tilemap. A short list of systems relevant to the
  active contract (origin, waypoints, destination) presented as a panel, not a
  `FlatGrid`/camera-driven view. If a literal starmap ever gets added it's a simple
  static node layout via `math`, not a scrolling `camera`-driven world.
- **Session/campaign length:** one contract spans decades to a century of in-game years;
  a full playthrough spans multiple contracts and multiple dynasty generations, ending
  only at dynasty extinction or player retirement.
- **Progression stages:**

  | Stage | Trigger | What changes |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Preparation | Contract accepted | Resource/crew allocation phase, no time pressure |
  | Travel → Operation → Return | Time advances | Event rolls active, milestones progress |
  | Completion | `current_year >= target_duration` | Success level computed (§5.2), Chronicle entry recorded |
  | Dynasty extinction / retirement | No eligible heir, or player choice | Playthrough ends; Chronicle renown sets the next dynasty's automatic Heritage tier |

- **Save/persistence model:** local save slots via `macroquad_toolkit::persistence`
  (`save_to_slot_with_version` / `load_from_slot_with_migration`) — this fully replaces
  the original's server-side JSON-blob store; there is no server-authoritative state to
  preserve (§0). Chronicle history (for Heritage modifiers) persists alongside the save
  slots as its own versioned file, since it must survive across separate playthroughs/
  save slots rather than living inside one slot.

## 8. Content Inventory

| Content type | Prototype target | Full target |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Event templates (across 4 categories) | 12 | **309 authored** |
| Ship hulls / engines / weapons | 3 / 3 / 3 (as original) | 5 / 5 / 5 |
| Contract objective templates | 4 (as original) | **22 across 6 objective families** |
| Legacy factions | 3 (fixed — Preservers/Adaptors/Wanderers) | 3 |
| Per-legacy dilemmas | 3–4 each (as original) | 6 each |
| Dynasty name/specialization/trait pools | as original (10 names/legacy, 10 specializations, 5 traits/legacy) | roughly doubled |
| Crew roles | 7 (as original) | 7 |
| Heritage tiers | 4 | **4 automatic renown tiers** |

The original's content is thin almost everywhere except the mechanics that consume it
(4 event templates trying to carry a century-scale campaign is the clearest gap) — the
full targets above are sized to make repeat playthroughs not feel like the same 4 events
on loop, not to invent new systems.

## 9. UI/UX & Screen Flow

| Screen | Purpose | Toolkit pieces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main Menu | New/continue/load slot, settings | `VirtualUi`, `SurfaceStyle`, buttons |
| Dashboard | Resources, ship status, crew summary, pending-event banner | `GridLayout`, meters, badges, `NotificationManager` |
| Ship Builder | Hull/engine/weapon purchase + current loadout | `GridLayout`, `TextStyle`, tooltips |
| Crew & Dynasty | Roster, train/recruit/heir actions, dynasty detail (merges the original's separate Crew Quarters + Dynasty Hall — dynasty actions are now real, not cosmetic, see §0) | `ScrollTabs`, meters |
| Contract & Systems | Active contract progress/milestones, relevant systems for the current journey (replaces the original's sprawling 50-system galaxy map, §0) | `GridLayout`, progress meters |
| Market | Buy/sell the 4 tradeable resources with price trend | `TextStyle`, simple table layout |
| Event/Decision modal | Resolve a triggered event or dilemma; shows outcome preview | `NotificationManager` / modal surface |
| Homecoming debrief | Full-screen takeover on contract conclusion: authored outcome prose, the pay actually banked, the scorecard behind the band, every captain the voyage passed through, and the voyage log (marks, legs, council decisions). The success counterpart to the extinction takeover | `ScrollArea`, `term_bar`, panels |
| Chronicle & Heritage | Cross-playthrough voyage log, renown, and the automatic tier inherited by a new dynasty | `ScrollTabs`, `TextStyle` |
| Pause/Settings | Time-advance pace, delegation toggles, save/load | `VirtualUi` |

Interaction flow (mirrors `realmseed/gdd.md`'s numbered turn structure):

1. Player reviews Dashboard; if a decision-required event is pending, it interrupts here.
2. Player allocates the turn (Ship Builder / Crew & Dynasty / Market as needed).
3. The underway clock advances at the selected pace (§5), producing resource/population
   deltas and possibly a new event; Pause freezes it immediately.
4. If the event needs a decision, the modal opens and blocks further advancement until
   resolved (or handled by a delegated advisor, which logs the outcome without
   blocking).
5. On contract completion, the Homecoming debrief takes the screen — the run's climax
   is read, not scrolled past — and filing the report lands the ship on the Drydock
   board for its next charter. The Chronicle keeps the across-playthrough record.

The debrief is built from state captured *while the voyage runs*, not read back
afterwards: the ship's log is trimmed to `log_limit` and `sim.contract` is cleared on
conclusion, so a 450-year charter would otherwise have forgotten its own departure by
the time it docks. Notable beats accrue onto the active contract
(`ActiveContract::highlights`, capped by `voyage_highlight_limit`, giving up council
decisions before marks and legs so the whole voyage stays represented), captaincies
accrue onto `Dynasty::reigns`, and conclusion seals a `VoyageDebrief` snapshot that
outlives both. The report is serialized, so quitting mid-read returns to it.

## 10. Toolkit Mapping

| Need | Toolkit module | Using it? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Input handling | `input` | Yes | Menu/button interaction only — no world input |
| Widgets/layout/text | `ui` (`VirtualUi`, `GridLayout`, `SurfaceStyle`, `TextStyle`, meters, badges, tabs, scroll) | Yes | Carries nearly the entire UI; this is a text/panel game |
| Textures/manifest | `assets` (`AssetManager`) | Minimal | No sprite art (§0); manifest kept minimal/empty for consistency |
| Camera/pan/zoom | `camera` | No | No rendered world/map (§7) |
| Cross-system messaging | `events` (`EventBus<UiAction>`) | Yes | Event/dilemma resolution, delegation toggles |
| Palette | `colors` | Yes | Reuse the original's amber/green/red terminal palette values |
| Vector/grid math | `math` | Maybe | Only if a literal starmap node layout is added |
| Frame timing | `timing` | Yes | Drives the real-time month auto-advance while under way (Pillar 4, superseded); frozen while docked |
| Particles/juice | `fx` | Minimal | A terminal-log game has little use for particles; maybe subtle text-flicker/typewriter effects |
| User settings | `settings` | Yes | Time-advance pace, delegation defaults |
| Unlocks/achievements | `achievements` | Maybe | Could back Chronicle milestones |
| Dev overlay | `debug` | Yes | Standard |
| Deterministic randomness | `rng` | Yes | Seeded LCG per §5.6 |
| Sprite animation | `sprite` | No | No sprites |
| Procedural images | `raster` | No | Not needed given the text-only presentation |
| Headless screenshot capture | `capture` | Yes (required for every game) | See `docs/screenshot_capture_harness_guide.md` |
| Save/load | `persistence` (`save_to_slot_with_version`, etc.) | Yes | Replaces the original's server-side save entirely (§7) |
| Tile grid / fog / pathing | `FlatGrid`, `FogState`, line-of-sight, flood-fill | No | No spatial world to model |

The near-total lean on `ui` with almost nothing from `camera`/`sprite`/`raster`/`FlatGrid`
is a direct consequence of the original having no world-rendering surface at all — this
is the leanest toolkit footprint of any port in this catalog, not a gap to fill.

- **`GameState` variants:** `Menu`, `Gameplay` (with an internal screen enum matching
  §9's tab list), `EventModal` (or nested inside `Gameplay` as a blocking sub-state).
- **Key stateless services (`simulation`):** `tick::advance_year`,
  `succession::process_generation`, `event_resolver::roll_and_resolve`,
  `contract::score_success`.
- **State that must persist across frames but never leak into UI:** the RNG stream
  state, the active contract's full `ExtendedResources`/`Population`/`Dynasty` data —
  UI panels read snapshots via accessors, never mutate directly (per
  `CODE_STANDARDS.md` §7's `UiAction` pattern).

## 12. Non-Goals / Open Questions

- **Explicitly not building (v1):** the Legacy Deck card meta-game, any server/account
  system, a literal scrolling galaxy map, real-time background simulation, per-character
  portraits or any commissioned art.
- **Differentiation note:** this sits closest to `apartment` (Second Story) in the
  catalog — both are succession/portfolio management sims. The differentiator is scope
  of "portfolio": `apartment` manages a growing set of *buildings* with independent
  tenants; Stellar Legacy manages *one vessel's bloodline* across centuries — no
  building-to-building comparison shopping, no multi-property expansion loop. If a
  system ever starts to feel like "manage N independent colonies," that's a signal it's
  drifted into `apartment`'s or `realmseed`'s territory and should be pulled back.
- **Open questions**, in priority order:

  1. Does a literal (even minimal) starmap node view earn its keep, or does the
     Contract & Systems panel stay a plain list permanently? Leaning list-only per
     Pillar 3 (don't build a panel that implies more depth than exists) unless multi-leg
     journeys become a real mechanic.
  2. Should the Legacy Deck concept return post-v1, or is its role (narrative color from
     past decisions) fully covered by the redesigned Chronicle/Heritage system? Leaning
     toward "Chronicle covers it" — revisit only if playtesting shows the Chronicle
     summary feels thin.
  3. Exact automation/delegation UI — how many domains can be delegated simultaneously,
     and does delegating everything trivialize the "century-scale" pacing goal?
  4. **(v2, §3.1) RESOLVED 2026-07-19 — owner confirmed the persistent-ship model.** A run
     is one mission on a persistent ship; on success the people/dynasty carry across and
     continue to build the legacy, and only game-over (extinction) resets to a new ship and
     new people. This needs no new persistence channel (the ship already lives in one saved
     `SimState`; "between missions" is `contract == None`). Also settled: ~1 hour is a soft
     cap and a run has a ~30-minute floor (sub-30 only via game-over); and the repair/loadout
     split — **underway** allows only field repairs (from carried consumables, never to
     pristine) and gated install of parts *found* on the voyage (if crew + part allow),
     while **full repair, full loadout, and commissioning a new ship are port-only**.

## 13. Milestones

| Milestone | Proves | Target content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1 — Mechanical proof | One contract playable start-to-finish: allocate → advance → event → succession → completion scoring, with placeholder data | 1 contract objective, 4 event templates (parity with original), 1 legacy |
| M2 — Playable prototype | Full turn loop with delegation, market, ship builder, dynasty actions all wired to real state (no cosmetic no-ops); a full playthrough can end in dynasty extinction and produce a Chronicle entry | Prototype content targets from §8 |
| M3 — Content-complete | All 3 legacies, full event/contract library, Heritage modifiers feeding a second playthrough, terminal UI/palette fully ported | Full targets from §8 |

After M1, follow the standard per-game loop: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`,
`cargo test`, then `.\publish.ps1` from the game directory to verify at the shared preview
root — same validation path as every other game in this repo, no exceptions for being new.
