# Stellar Legacy

A generational starship strategy game in Rust + Macroquad. You are the standing
council of a generation ship — captains age out, heirs inherit, and every promise
the ship makes will be kept (or broken) by someone else's grandchildren.

- **Design:** `gdd.md` (authoritative — pillars, systems, formulas, milestones)
- **Content direction:** `content_depth.md` (the standing north star for deepening
  passes — hard rules, established mechanics, depth axes, quality bars)
- **Event authoring:** `event_design_notes.md` (families × complications × outcomes,
  phase pools, gating house rules)
- **Open work:** `TODO.md`
- Port of the web original `game_apps/stellar_legacy/` (React/PHP); all game rules
  now live in a deterministic Rust simulation, saves are local toolkit slots.

The current release contains 327 event templates, 22 charters across six objective
families, three legacies, six founding factions, six maintainable subsystems, and a
month-precise voyage clock. Under way, time advances automatically at the displayed
Pause / 1× / 2× / 3× pace; drydock and blocking council decisions freeze it. Chronicle
renown automatically applies the highest unlocked Heritage tier when a new dynasty is
founded—Heritage is a transparent head start, not a separate modifier choice.
Restrained procedural ambience and redundant cues are mixed from the Display panel;
critical state remains fully readable with audio muted.

The primary flow is New Game → legacy and founding peoples → drydock charter dossier →
preparation checklist → launch → dashboard/specialist screens and council decisions →
Homecoming debrief → drydock. Chronicle, Help, and Display remain available from the
command shell.
