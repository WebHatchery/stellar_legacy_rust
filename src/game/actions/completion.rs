//! What happens when a charter concludes: the pay, the marks it leaves on the
//! ship and its people, the Chronicle entry, and the homecoming report the
//! player is shown. Split out of `actions.rs` (which dispatches every other
//! verb) because the homecoming is the campaign's climax and had grown to the
//! largest single branch in that file.
//!
//! Order matters here. Everything that reads the concluded charter — the pay,
//! the faction sentiment, the lasting legacy, the sealed debrief — must run
//! *before* `sim.contract` is cleared, because clearing it discards the
//! metrics, milestones, and remembered beats the report is built from.
