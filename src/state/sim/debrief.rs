//! The record a voyage leaves behind: the beats worth remembering, captured as
//! they happen, and the sealed homecoming report the debrief screen reads.
//!
//! Both exist because the running state cannot answer "what happened on this
//! voyage" once it is over. The ship's log is trimmed to `log_limit` (200
//! lines), so a 300-year crossing has forgotten its own departure by the time
//! it docks; `sim.contract` is cleared the moment a charter concludes, taking
//! the metrics and milestones with it. So the notable beats accrue onto the
//! active contract while it flies, and completion seals a snapshot that
//! survives the contract's own end (and a save/quit in the middle of reading
//! it).
