//! Founding factions (W7): population segments carried within one campaign.

//! roster change (loss/merger/recruit), log/event coloring, and a one-time
//! recruitment dowry per people (content-depth round 7), ongoing approval,
//! political relationships, and their effects on the ship's shared life.
