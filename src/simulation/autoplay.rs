//! Automated full-mission playthrough harness (W1-rescale).

//! The owner's primary playtest channel: a deterministic *policy player* that
//! starts a charter and flies it year by year with a fixed, dumb strategy —
//! resolve every council decision by first choice, patch the hull when it
//! slips, buy food when the stores run low — then reports how the voyage
//! ended. It exists to soak the whole content set (events, dilemmas,
//! succession, contract completion) across a generational voyage and catch any
//! invariant that escapes its range along the way.
//!
//! Test-only: it drives the same stateless services the game does, so a green
//! soak means a real campaign of that length stays internally consistent.
