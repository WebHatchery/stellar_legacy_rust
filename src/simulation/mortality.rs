//! Aboard a generation ship, everyone shares a birthday: the last day of the

//! their true birthdate. So [`annual_aging`] runs on each year boundary and adds
//! one year to every dynasty member and crew officer.
//!
//! *Death*, by contrast, is a monthly roll — [`monthly_tick`] gives each living
//! character a chance to die every month, low for the young and climbing with
//! age past `onset_age`, certain at `member_max_age`. A dead leader (or one who
//! has aged past retirement with an heir waiting) triggers succession here too.
//! A heavy population-loss event can additionally claim a named character via
