//! The economic year (GDD §5.1), applied whole on each year boundary of the
//! month clock (W3): production, food upkeep, ship wear, voyage drift,
//! generation/succession, and market drift — the W1-tuned yearly math, split
//! out of `tick.rs` to keep the advance loop readable and the file under the
//! size limit.
//!
//! The year runs in six phases, each in its own module and each applied whole
//! in the order below. They are ordered, not independent: production settles
//! before the morale it feeds, and the modules wear before they are given a
//! voice.
