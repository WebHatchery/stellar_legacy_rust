//! Procedural ship schematic (mission SHIP tab): a blueprint of the vessel
//! built from its actual loadout and subsystems, with each module highlighted by
//! condition, tier, and crew manning.
//!
//! Two halves, split so the layout is testable without a live frame:
//! [`build`] is a pure, deterministic function that reads `&SimState` and returns
//! a [`ShipSchematic`] of positioned glyphs (no macroquad calls, no RNG); [`draw`]
//! and [`draw_status_strip`] render that spec. Because `build` reads the sim fresh
//! each frame, the picture reacts on its own to anything that changes mid-mission —
//! a subsystem repaired or upgraded, a salvaged part field-installed, or a crew
//! member added by an event — with no wiring beyond the per-frame call.
