//! HOMECOMING: the full-screen report a charter comes home with (GDD §5.2).
//!
//! The counterpart to `game_over` — extinction already got a takeover screen
//! and a final readout, while success, the run's actual climax, was two lines
//! pushed into a scrolling log that scrolls away. This screen is where the
//! voyage is paid, scored, and remembered: what the writ paid, how the score
//! was arrived at, which marks were made, what the council decided along the
//! way, and every captain who held the chair between launch and homecoming.
//!
//! Pure view, like every screen here: it reads `sim.debrief` and returns a
//! single [`UiAction::FileReport`] when the player is done reading.
